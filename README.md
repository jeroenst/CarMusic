  - Shows Title, artist, album, folder, bitrate and codec type
  - Shows fanart
  - Can switch between folders
  - Scans folders recursively
 
Audio files need to be in /sdcard/Music or in /storage/extsd/Music

Features/bugfixes to be added:
  - Respond to steering wheel buttons
  - Stop playing when other app starts playing audio
  - Set text/button color to match car interior
  
Unfortunatly this app won't be available on the playstore because Google charges $25 to be a developer which is mandatory for publishing apps on the playstore.
