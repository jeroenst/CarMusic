  - Shows Title, artist, album, folder, bitrate and codec type
  - Shows fanart
  - Can switch between folders
  - Scans folders recursively
  - Respond to steering wheel buttons
 
Audio files need to be in /sdcard/Music or in /storage/extsd/Music

Features to be added:
  - Stop playing when other app starts playing audio
  - Set text/button color to match car interior
  - Choose folders (now hardcoded to /sdcard/Music and storage/extsd/Music)
  
Unfortunatly this app won't be available on the playstore because Google charges $25 to be a developer which is mandatory for publishing apps on the playstore.
